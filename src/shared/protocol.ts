/**
 * Versioned typed message protocol between the extension host and the webview.
 *
 * Why a single Document variant (and not Revive / Update):
 *   The host is the canonical owner of the document. Every content push to the
 *   webview is the *same* operation — "here is the authoritative snapshot at
 *   docVersion N" — regardless of what triggered it (initial mount, panel
 *   revive, external editor change, or echo of a webview-accepted edit). The
 *   webview's reaction is identical in all four cases: replace editor state
 *   with content, apply theme, update write capability, drop if stale. The
 *   legacy `reason` discriminator is gone from the type — see
 *   `DocumentMessage` JSDoc below for the validator pass-through and emitter
 *   key-set pin.
 *
 * Why baseDocVersion (and not docVersion / nextDocVersion) on Edit:
 *   The host owns docVersion (it derives from VS Code's native
 *   TextDocument.version). The webview cannot mint version numbers — it can
 *   only declare "this is the version I was editing on top of." The host
 *   accepts the edit iff baseDocVersion === lastAppliedDocVersion; on accept
 *   it calls applyEdit, reads the resulting TextDocument.version as the new
 *   lastAppliedDocVersion, and pushes the next authoritative Document.
 *
 * Why a separate `protocol` envelope field:
 *   `protocol: 1` is the negotiation point for any future incompatible change.
 *   When `protocol: 2` is needed, peers can detect mismatch at the boundary
 *   before parsing the payload. Adding the field now costs nothing; adding it
 *   later requires coordinated rollout.
 *
 * Rules for this module:
 *   - No imports beyond TypeScript itself. No `vscode`, no `react`, no DOM.
 *     Both sides of the bridge consume it; either-side-only dependencies break
 *     the other side's build.
 *   - Validators are hand-rolled. A 4 KB module beats a 40 KB dependency for
 *     four discriminated unions.
